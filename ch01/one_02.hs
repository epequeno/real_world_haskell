-- From ghci type :? to print some help. Define a variable, such as let x = 1
-- and then :show bindings. What do you see?

-- it :: Integer = 4
-- x :: Integer = _

-- This shows that the 'it' is the last evaluated thing, in this case the 
-- variable x set to the integer 4.  Not sure what the signifigance of 
-- the _ is when it comes to the x.
